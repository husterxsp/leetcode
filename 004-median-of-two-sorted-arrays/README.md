### 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

解题思路:
1. 题目要求log时间复杂度，首先考虑到二分查找
2.
